Q2 2025 Business Operations Report

Overview:
The past quarter saw continued growth in user acquisition and customer engagement. However, several operational inefficiencies continue to hinder scalability across departments.

1. Sales & Marketing:
- Our sales representatives spend approximately 35% of their time on manual data entry and CRM updates.
- Lead scoring is still a manual process, resulting in delayed follow-ups and missed opportunities.
- Ad campaigns are optimized based on static rules rather than dynamic insights, resulting in a low return on ad spend (ROAS).

2. Finance:
- Budget forecasting relies heavily on spreadsheets and manual reconciliation.
- Invoicing errors have led to a 4% revenue leakage.
- Accounts payable and receivable tracking is prone to human error, delaying monthly closings.

3. Customer Support:
- Customer service queries increased by 27% compared to the previous quarter.
- Most tickets are categorized manually, leading to inconsistent tagging and slower response times.
- There is no unified knowledge base, and agents rely on tribal knowledge.

4. Product Development:
- Bug triaging and prioritization are currently handled via Slack and Excel.
- Feature requests from customers are not automatically categorized or fed into the product roadmap.

5. Human Resources:
- Resume screening for open roles is entirely manual and takes an average of 14 days.
- Employee engagement surveys are conducted quarterly, but analysis takes up to two weeks to finalize.

Opportunities:
There is a pressing need to automate repetitive tasks, optimize decisions using data, and build scalable internal tooling to prepare for expansion into new markets.
